[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=matteosecli/tp4-exercises)

This repository contains numerical exercises on open quantum systems.

## Run Online

### MATLAB
- [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=matteosecli/tp4-exercises) Run the `.mlx` files in MATLAB Online.  
**Important:** you need a MathWorks account linked to a valid cloud license.
- [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/matteosecli/jupyter-matlab/main?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fmatteosecli%252Ftp4-exercises%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252Ftp4-exercises%252F%26branch%3Dmain) Run the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter with the MATLAB kernel on myBinder.org, or use "Open MATLAB" and run the `.mlx` files.  
**Important:** you may have to manually run `cd tp4-exercises` in an empty Jupyter cell before running the notebook.  
**Warning:** it may take serveral minutes to launch the instance, plus more time to launch MATLAB the first time. MyBinder instances can be very slow and easily timeout. You need a MathWorks account linked to a valid cloud license.

### Octave
- [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/matteosecli/jupyter-matlab/main?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fmatteosecli%252Ftp4-exercises%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252Ftp4-exercises%252F%26branch%3Dmain) Run the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter with the Octave kernel on myBinder.org.  
**Warning:**  MyBinder instances can be very slow and easily timeout.

### Julia
- [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://ovh.mybinder.org/v2/gh/matteosecli/jupyter-matlab/with-julia?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fmatteosecli%252Ftp4-exercises%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252Ftp4-exercises%252F%26branch%3Dmain) Run the `-julia.ipynb` files in Jupyter with the Julia kernel on myBinder.org.  
**Warning:**  MyBinder instances can be very slow and easily timeout.

## Run in Codespaces (Î²)

You can also use GitHub Codespaces runners if you have a GitHub account. Click on the button below to open the workspace (building will take quite some time):

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/matteosecli/jupyter-matlab/tree/with-devcontainer)

and clone the exercises repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/matteosecli/tp4-exercises.git && cd tp4-exercises
```

The Julia kernel should work with no additional setup.

The Octave kernel has to be manually selected under the "Jupyter kernels" section, and has limited plotting capabilities.

For optimal support for all kernels under a Jupyter Lab environment, open a terminal, run
```
xvfb-run jupyter lab
```
copy the token, click on the "Open in Browser" button that appears, and paste the token.

## Run Locally

### MATLAB
- Install MATLAB (depending on your system)
- Clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/matteosecli/tp4-exercises.git` (preferred) or download a [zipped copy](https://github.com/matteosecli/tp4-exercises/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it (discouraged)
- Open MATLAB in the folder containing the exercises
- Run the `.mlx` files
- Note: If you prefer to work with `.ipynb` files, you have to install the MATLAB/Jupyter integration first ([info](https://www.mathworks.com/products/reference-architectures/jupyter.html))

### Octave
- Install Octave (depending on your system)
- Clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/matteosecli/tp4-exercises.git` (preferred) or download a [zipped copy](https://github.com/matteosecli/tp4-exercises/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it (discouraged)
- Open Octave in the folder containing the exercises
- Run the `.m` files
- Note: If you prefer to work with `.ipynb` files, you have to install the Octave/Jupyter integration first ([info](https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel))

### Julia
- TODO
